an easy reversing ELF file , that taks usernage and password as an "argv" 

it'll tell you if any of them is messing . 

then it compairs username+"1234" with the password  


so if the the user intered test as username then the password has to be test1234 

no apacific input is requred only pass has to be the same as user+"1234"



>> also it can be solve by changeing the zero flag befor jumping .
