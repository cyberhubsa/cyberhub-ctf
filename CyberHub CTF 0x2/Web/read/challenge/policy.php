<div class="innerText">We will notify the users via in-site notification</div>
<div class="innerText">      <strong>•</strong> Within 7 business days</div>
<div class="innerText">We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law.
