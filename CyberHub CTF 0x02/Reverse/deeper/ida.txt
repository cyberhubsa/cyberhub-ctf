elf has many insted if & else if ( 5 levels , first one has 1 if and 3 else if each one of it has the same number of if and else if appended to it till the level 5 ) and the flag is corrapted and split in 3 of then and each level of those 3 has a part  so you have to do sympolic excution or you'll solve it in a vey long time .


open the elf using dis-assmybiler , you'll see to many jne/jnz and scanf , in each jne/jnz there is printf(random string)

search for a unquie string like ( flag or secret )

for secrit you'll find
secret1end: (part of the flag)
secret2end: (part of the flag)
secret3end: (part of the flag) b64 makes it cool

you python angr and do sympolic execution and seach for the path for each one string of thim 

then it will give you the password of the path for every one

use each one on the elf to collect the three parts 

for each path start majing the output from buttom to top as it is in the output ( secret end: (part of the flag) ) this is the end of the path not the start . 


after collecting the three part filter them to be in base64 form and decode it
